A fun little project with emulation. Nothing big, was just curious in emulating stuff.

To use Chipacabra on your own desktop machine, clone this repo and run "cmake ." in the selected emulator directory. Run "make" in the same directory. Navigate to the "/bin/" directory and run "./{Selected-Emulator-Binary} {Selected-ROM}". Have fun!

## Future Functionality
- Logging System
- Embedded/Desktop compatiblity (Depending on CMake flags)
- Chip 8 PCB
- Streamline code format (Code formatting is wack af rn due to me personally coming from a C background into C++ OOP format)
- Super Chip configuration
